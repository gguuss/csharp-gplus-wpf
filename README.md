**Notice** [Google+ API is shutting down on March 7th, 2019](https://developers.google.com/+/api-shutdown).

# Demo: Google+ integration with C#/.NET/WPF
A very basic demonstration of how you can create an application
that uses Google+ Sign-In in WPF.

The code demonstrates:
* Triggering the OAuth v2 flow
* Getting the authorization code after the flow concludes
* Exchanging the authorization code for OAuth v2 credentials
* Configuring the Google+ Client with the credentials
* Performing API requests against Google+ using the API

## Running the demo

* Open the project.
* Create a client ID and client secret for your application on 
  the [Google API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console).
* Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the ones you 
  created.
